The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the database rules are too restrictive or incorrectly configured. This can happen even if your code is syntactically correct.  For example, if your rules don't allow read access for the authenticated user, any attempt to retrieve data will result in a permission denied error. Another common issue is that rules might allow writes but not reads.  Incorrectly using the `orderByChild` method can also lead to unexpected errors if the specified child doesn't exist in all nodes.  Finally, exceeding the maximum data size limits set by Firebase can also result in errors during upload or retrieval.
