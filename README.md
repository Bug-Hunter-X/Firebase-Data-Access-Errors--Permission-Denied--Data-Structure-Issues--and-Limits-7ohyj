# Firebase Data Access Errors
This repository demonstrates common data access errors in Firebase and provides solutions.  Issues include permission denied errors due to incorrect database rules, unexpected errors from faulty data structure use (e.g., `orderByChild`), and problems arising from exceeding Firebase data limits.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases these issues, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` offers corrected code and explanations.
