To fix permission denied errors, carefully review and adjust your Firebase Realtime Database rules to grant the necessary read and write access to the authenticated users. Ensure that the rules correctly reflect your application's data access requirements.  For issues related to data structure, ensure that the path you're using in `orderByChild` exists in all nodes. Use more robust methods to handle data retrieval if the child field might be absent in some data points. To prevent issues with exceeding data limits, consider optimizing your data structure, batching uploads, and implementing data compression where feasible.  Regularly monitor your Firebase usage to avoid exceeding the limits.
